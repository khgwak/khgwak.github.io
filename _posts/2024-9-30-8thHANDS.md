Our team won 1st place at the <a href="https://hands-workshop.org/challenge2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8th HANDS workshop challenge</a> - ARCTIC track! [<a href="https://hands-workshop.org/files/2024/UVHANDS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Technical Report</a>]

This challenge targets bimanual category-agnostic reconstruction, avoiding reliance on pre-scanned object templates. It tackles the difficulties of natural two-hand manipulation, including severe occlusions and dynamic contacts, using the <a href="https://arctic.is.tue.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARCTIC</a> dataset.
