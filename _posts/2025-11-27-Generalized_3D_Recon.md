I have organized the key concepts and recent advancements in Hand-Object reconstruction. [<a href="/assets/Towards%20Generalized%203D%20Reconstruction%20in%20Hand-Object%20Interaction.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>]

This report reviews the evolution of 3D reconstruction in Hand-Object Interaction (HOI), specifically the shift from category-specific priors to generalized, category-agnostic solutions. It covers the essential theoretical foundations and analyzes representative frameworks like [<a href="https://zc-alexfan.github.io/hold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HOLD</a>] and [<a href="https://cvpr.thecvf.com/virtual/2025/poster/34060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BIGS</a>], aiming to recover both geometry and appearance from visual observations.
